# Pentagon Diagram for ISAK
This is a diagram to help students show how far they've progressed in five different areas: awareness, creativity, self-discipline, action-taking, and connecting.

## How to run:
*Git needs to be [installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)*
1. Clone the [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
2. Open index.html in the browser of your choice

## Key Features:
1. Should be embeddable on a Wix site using an <iframe>
2. Should be able to reference how much of a section was selected

## TODO
* ~~Make the pentagon highlight all points below it~~
* ~~Include Arial~~
* Fix the color gradient of shards
* ~~Add labels for each shard~~
* Title editable
* ~~Fix UWC logo~~

### Coaching Questions
* ~~Make new coaching questions, questions are editable~~
* ~~Coaching questions highlight the correct areas~~
* Figure out how to make it editable externally

## BUGS
* When you `dblclick()` on a triangle shard, if the mouse does not hover hover the other pieces, they will not change back to `NORMAL_COLOR`
